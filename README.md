The blue brain is the first virtual brain in the world. It is a machine that can work like the human brain. At present scientists are trying to make a virtual brain that will be able to make decisions and keep information in the memory. The idea is to upload the human brain into the machine. So that man can think without any efforts. The main advantage of this project is that even after the death of the person, we can use the knowledge and intelligence of that person.
